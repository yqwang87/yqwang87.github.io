                    <h1>Hey World! Introducing YQ Aka "Snowflake"</h1>
                    <p class="margin_bottom" style="text-align:justify">Snowflake was captured in the Rio Muni region in Equatorial Guinea on October 1, 1966 by ethnic Fang
                        farmer Benito Mañé. Mañé had killed the rest of Snowflake's gorilla group (who were normal in color).
                        Mañé then kept Snowflake at his home for four days before transporting him to Bata, where he was
                        purchased by primatologist Jordi Sabater Pi. Originally named "Nfumu Ngui" in Fang language ("white
                        gorilla") by his captor, he was then nicknamed "Floquet de Neu" (Catalan for "little snowflake")
                        by his keeper Jordi Sabater Pi. Snowflake was a Western lowland gorilla with non-syndromic oculocutaneous
                        albinism. Snowflake had unpigmented skin and hair. Snowflake had poor vision, which is associated
                        with albinism. A test to try to determine whether Snowflake had a central blind spot did not find
                        one. Barcelona Zoo director Antonio Jonch wrote: "The eye had a blueish sclera, a normal cornea,
                        and a light blue iris which was very transparent to transillumination. Accommodation and refraction
                        were normal. The media were transparent and the fundus of the eye normal and totally depigmented.
                        The choroidal vessels were perfectly visible and the pupil was normal. The animal displayed marked
                        photophobia which caused it to close its eyes repeatedly when exposed to bright light. In diffuse
                        light similar to that in its biotope, we calculated that it blinked on an average of 20 times a minute."
                        Study of Snowflake's genome determined that his parents had 12% of their DNA in common, leading researchers
                        to believe that his parents were uncle and niece. The same study revealed that his albinism was caused
                        by a mutation of SLC45A2 gene. Snowflake received the recessive gene from both parents, causing his
                        albinism.

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The asteroid 95962 Copito, discovered by Spanish astronomer J. Manteca, is named in his honour. A scholarship
                    for research on primatology was created in memory of and homage to Snowflake. Snowflake's fame also helped
                    to promote awareness of the endangered gorilla species. The gorilla became a main character in the novel
                    Memòries d'en Floquet de Neu ("Snowflake's Memories") by Catalan writer Toni Sala. Sabater Pi also dedicated
                    a book to the gorilla, under the title Copito para Siempre (Snowflake Forever). He also makes a brief
                    appearance in Italo Calvino's novel Mr. Palomar - the passage is a meditation on loneliness, captivity,
                    the burden of being unique in the world, and mortality. Nature on PBS devoted an episode to him. Former
                    U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins wrote of Snowflake in his poem, "Searching," published in his 2008 collection,
                    Ballistics. Snowflake appears on the front cover of dance music act Basement Jaxx's album Rooty. While
                    playing at FC Barcelona, Dutch football player Ronald Koeman was nicknamed Copito de Nieve because of
                    his blond hair. Snowflake appeared on The Triplets (Les Tres Bessones) episode "The Triplets meet King
                    Kong" as a guest of honor for the appearance of King Kong in Barcelona's Olympic Stadium. In 2009 French
                    musician Enzo Enzo released the album Toutim where the song Copito De Nieve De Barcelone is dedicated
                    to Snowflake. In 2011, there was a live action/CGI film called Snowflake, the White Gorilla that depicts
                    the fictional childhood of Snowflake (voiced by Ariana Grande). In the 2017 film War for the Planet of
                    the Apes, there was an albino gorilla which closely resembles Snowflake named Winter (played by Aleks
                    Paunovic), who appears in Caesar's tribe and was defected to the Colonel's side.
